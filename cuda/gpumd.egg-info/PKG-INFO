Description: ### Creating conda environment 
        
        Here, we assume that you have a working C/C++ compiler and that it supports the **C++14** or newer standard. In the existing conda environment (ABP) please install these additional packages:
        
        * cmake
        * ipympl
        * nodejs
        
        ``conda install -c anaconda cmake ``
        
        ``conda install -c conda-forge ipympl``
        
        ``conda install -c conda-forge nodejs``
        
        
        
        Please also install the following extensions for **JupyterLab**:
        
        
        
        ``jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager jupyter-matplotlib``
        
        
        
        ##  Installing cppmd module
        
        In order to make the Python modules visible, please install the cppmd module. From the **``ABPTutorial/c++``**  directory type:
        
        ``python setup.py install``
        
        In order to test the installation, you can type 
        
        
        
        ``python -c 'from cppmd.md import *; b = Box(10.0, 10.0); print(b)'`` 
        
        
        
        If the cppmd module has been properly installed, the output of the previous line should look like:
        
        ```python
        <box Lx = 10 Ly = 10 
        <box Lx = (-5, 5)
        <box Ly = (-5, 5)
        periodic_Lx = 1 periodic_Ly = 1 >
        ```
