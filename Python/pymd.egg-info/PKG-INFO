Description: # pymd module
        
        This is a simple implementation of a 2D simulations of Active Brownian Particles. Particles can interact
        with each other view a short-range soft repulsive potential and can align the direction of their motion.
        
        This module has been designed as a part of the series of tutorials delivered in the KITP ACTIVE20 virtual programme.
